<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MDO-PE Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blown Films</li><li>Cast Films</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MDO-PE films, or Machine Direction Oriented Polyethylene films, are categorized into two primary types: blown films and cast films. Blown films are produced by extruding polyethylene through a circular die, creating a continuous tube that is inflated to form a thin film, known for its strength and barrier properties. In contrast, cast films are formed by extruding the polymer into a flat sheet, which is then cooled and solidified quickly, offering excellent clarity and surface smoothness. Each type serves distinct applications based on their properties.</p></p>
